<h1> Schedule app <h1>

<h2>A project to simplify my previous profession<h2>

<p>As a 911 Dispatcher working within a small team thar required the position to be operated 24/7, our team worked on a rotation of 4 days of work and two days off.
This made scheduling anything in advance difficult as the days I would be scheduled to work would change every week. To solve thet problem I built this app that accepts input for how a number of consecutive workdays, followed by the number of consective days of, then accepts input for how far into the future you'd like to track the schedule and finally asks for a "day one" or the first day of any rotation as the schedule begins tracking with the first work day.

This app has made scheduling appointments and vacations as simple as just a few clicks. I have offered several coworkers access to the app and so far it's ben a hit!</p>
